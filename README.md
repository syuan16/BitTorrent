# BitTorrent

BitTorrent is a protocol for downloading and distributing files across the internet. In contrast with the traditional client/server relationship, in which download client connects to a central server, BitTorrent clients participate (called peers), download pieces of files from each other, making it a peer-to-peer protocol. This BitTorrent I built will find peers based on the given torrent file and exchange data among them.
